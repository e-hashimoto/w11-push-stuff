Your goal is to set up this application so that you can render the form as pictured in `/images/working_form.png`, and submit that form such that you receive the response as pictured in `/images/successful_response.png`.

You only need to find and resolve a series of bugs.  New lines of code should not be necessary.

Debugging code is a vital skill.  Please do not share bugs that you find with other students.  Treat this exercise as a benchmark for your level of understanding of the mod 4 material so far.

If you don't finish in the allotted time, that's ok!  Hold onto it and continue to work on it over the weekend for extra practice.
