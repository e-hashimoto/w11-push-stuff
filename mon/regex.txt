Regex: pattern-matching machine

Take some pattern and test against input values: Is there a match and what did match?

When given a string, needs to match EXACTLY.
    Ex: if 'pat', need EXACTLY 'pat'.  Case-sensitive

* Operator: 0+ of what we are looking for
    Ex: th*e === look for th(0 or more h's)e --> 'pattern' works
    Ex: at* === look for at(0 or more t's) --> 'pattern' works

? Operator: 0 or 1 of what's right BEFORE input
    Ex: at?t === a, zero or one t, t

    whAT is the pATTern? --> CAPS is what matches the pattern
