HTML FORMS: an Intro

    Key components of a form:
        <form>
            - parent element of all input fields
            - has 2 unique attributes
                - action
                    1. defines the location (URL) where the form should send
                        the data to when it is submitted
                - method
                    1. defines the HTTP verb that should be used to make the
                        request to the server
                    2. browsers support only two values: "get" and "post"

        <input>
            - contains a type attribute: tells the browser what kind of input it expects,
                browser enforces different rules for each type of input
            - has a name attribute: represents data as a key-value pair with the value of the
                name attribute set as the key
            - id attribute ties input element with label element by matching label element's
                "for" attribute


    Submitting the form
        Server-side validations ensure that the form is submitted correctly
